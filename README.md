# Cpp-constexpr

Repository contains a program that manages bakery. It was written for advanced C++ classes. It is interesting that, it uses 
C++17 compile-time features.

There is Pi and Ln(2) calculated at compile time. There are template types that have 
some complex requirements to compile. For example Bakery checks, if all Products 
have unique types, otherwise compilation error is raised. It requires a lot of not-obvious tricks.
